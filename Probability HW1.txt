A(Q1):
The number of ways to choose 2 students from a population of 250 students is given by the combination formula  = (250!)/(2!(250-2)!) = 31125.


A(Q2):
The number of distinct bit strings that can be formed from three 0’s and two 1’s is given by the combination formula 5C2 = (5!)/(2!(5-2)!) = 10.


A(Q3):
The number of bit strings of length 5 that start and end with 1’s is equal to the number of bit strings of length 3, which is 2^3 = 8.


A(Q4):
The number of ways to give three awards to 30 players such that each player can receive at most one award is given by the combination formula 30C3 = (30!)/(3!(30-3)!) = 4060.


A(Q5):
The number of ways to select 3 books from 6 distinct books is given by the combination formula 6C3 = (6!)/(3!(6-3)!) = 20.


A(Q6):
The probability of rolling a 7 with a pair of dice is 6/36 = 1/6. The probability of not rolling a 7 with a pair of dice is 5/6.

The probability of not rolling a 7 in three tries is (5/6)^3 = 125/216. Therefore, the probability of rolling at least one 7 in three tries is 1 - (125/216) = 91/216.


A(Q7):
First, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 books from 6 without any restrictions. This is given by the formula C(6,3) = 6!/(3!*(6-3)!) = 20.
Next, we need to subtract the number of ways to select 3 books from 6 that include both of the books that should not be chosen together. This is given by the formula C(2,2) * C(4,1) = 1 * 4 = 4. This means we choose both of the restricted books and one of the remaining four books.
Finally, we get the answer by subtracting the second number from the first number: 20 - 4 = 14. This means there are 14 ways to select 3 books from 6 that do not include both of the restricted books.


A(Q8):
(a) The number of different 14-student study-groups that can be formed such that within the study group, there is exactly one student with name “Ahmed”, exactly one student with name “Sally”, exactly one student with name “Mariam”, exactly one student with name “Yousef”, and exactly one student with name “Ibrahim” is equal to the product of the number of ways to choose 1 student from each of the five groups and then choose 9 students from the remaining 20 students. Therefore, the number of different 14-student study-groups is (2C1) * (2C1) * (2C1) * (2C1) * (2C1) * (20C9) = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * (20! / (9! * 11!)) =  5,350,720

(b) The number of ways a team could be formed such that this team will contain two students both with name “Ahmed”, two students both with name “Sally”, two students both with name “Mariam”, two students both with name “Yousef”, and two students both with name “Ibrahim” is equal to the product of the number of ways to choose 2 students from each of the five groups. Therefore, the number of ways a team could be formed is (2C2) * (2C2) * (2C2) * (2C2) * (2C2) = 1
